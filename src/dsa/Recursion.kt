/**
 * Recursion is when a function calls itself.
 *
 * Every recursive function has two cases: the base case and the recursive case.
 *
 * A stack has two operations: push and pop.
 *
 * All function calls go onto the call stack.
 *
 * The call stack can get very large, which takes up a lot of memory.
